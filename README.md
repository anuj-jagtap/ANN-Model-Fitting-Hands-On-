Artificial Neural Network (ANN) – Hands-On Practice & Analysis

📌 Overview

This repository contains a structured, hands-on practice of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.
The goal of this practice is to understand how ANN learns, how hyperparameters affect performance, and how to diagnose model behavior using loss curves and evaluation metrics.

🎯 Objectives

- Understand ANN model fitting for regression
- Analyze the effect of hyperparameters
- Learn model diagnostics using loss curves
- Compare ANN with classical models
- Build strong conceptual intuition

🧰 Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

📂 Practice Breakdown
1️⃣ Effect of Number of Neurons
- Trained ANN models with different neuron counts
- Observed underfitting and improved learning
- Learned bias–variance tradeoff

2️⃣ Effect of Activation Functions
- Compared ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid
- Observed convergence behavior and performance
- Understood vanishing gradient problem

3️⃣ Effect of Learning Rate
- Experimented with different learning rates
- Studied convergence speed and stability
- Learned importance of choosing suitable learning rate

4️⃣ Effect of Batch Size
- Trained models using small, medium, and large batch sizes
- Analyzed impact on learning efficiency and generalization

5️⃣ Overfitting & Regularization
- Created an overfitting ANN model
- Applied Dropout and Early Stopping
- Improved generalization performance

6️⃣ Error Metrics Analysis
- Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and RMSE
- Learned interpretation of different error metrics
- Analyzed error consistency and outliers

7️⃣ ANN vs Linear Regression
- Compared ANN with Linear Regression
- Observed that simpler models can outperform ANN on linear data
- Reinforced importance of model selection

8️⃣ Loss Curve Interpretation
- Plotted training and validation loss
- Diagnosed convergence, underfitting, and overfitting

📊 Key Learnings
- ANN performance is highly sensitive to hyperparameters
- More complexity does not always improve results
- Proper evaluation and diagnostics are essential
- Model choice should always be data-driven


📜 Conclusion
This practice provides a complete foundation for understanding ANN behavior, tuning, and evaluation, bridging the gap between theory and practical implementation.
