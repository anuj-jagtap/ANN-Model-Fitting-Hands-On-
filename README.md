# ANN-Model-Fitting-Hands-On-
This repository contains hands-on practice of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using Python and TensorFlow. It covers model fitting, activation functions, learning rate and batch size analysis, regularization, error metrics, and comparison with Linear Regression to understand ANN learning behavior and generalization.
